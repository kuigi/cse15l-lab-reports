## Part 1: Debugging Scenario

A student makes an Edstem post as follows:

**Anonymous:**
Someone help me pLEASEE!!!!!!!!!! I'm trying to test out my chat server, but I keep on failing this test that I swear
should pass even though it's failing. It keeps on giving me this error whenever I run the test, but I know my code for the serve
is right and I tested it using the URL just now.

Here's the output for the tester:

I'm not sure what's wrong, everything looks the same as the other tests and I think I'm following the
right syntax according to
